# `roastery`

`roastery` is a framework for effectively working with the Beancount plain text
accounting software.

## Features

- **Import transactions in bulk** &mdash; Easily add new transaction
  information in bulk from data provided by your financial institutions.
- **Polished workflow for manual edits** &mdash; Is the data from your bank a
  mess? Easily classify your transactions and clean up your transaction data
  with a set of CLI tools that are optimized for speed.
- **Automate data clean up and classification** &mdash; Getting tired of making
  the same edits by hand? Write rules in Python to automatically classify and
  clean up transaction data.
- **Plays nice with version control** &mdash; Edit one of your automatic rules?
  Re-run your imports, and see the effect with a `git diff`. Manual edits are
  stored separately from original data, and the generated beancount files, so
  you can always re-run your imports.
- **High quality documentation** &mdash; Roastery comes with a well-documented
  Python API and getting started guide.
